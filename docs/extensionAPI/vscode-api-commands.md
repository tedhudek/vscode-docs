# Complex Commands API

This document lists a set of complex commands that we consider stable. They are called complex commands because they require parameters and often return a value. You can use the commands in conjunction with the `executeCommand` API.

The following is a sample of how to preview a HTML document:

```javascript
let uri = Uri.parse('file:///some/path/to/file.html');
let success = await commands.executeCommand('vscode.previewHtml', uri);
```

# HTML Programming in VS Code

VS Code provides basic support for HTML programming out of the box. Install an extension for greater functionality. 

<div class="marketplace-extensions-html"></div>

> Tip: The extensions shown above are dynamically queried. Click on an extension tile above to read the description and reviews to decide which extension is best for you. See more in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com).

## IntelliSense

As you type in HTML, we offer suggestions via HTML IntelliSense.  In the image below you can see a suggested HTML element closure `</div>` as well as a context specific list of suggested elements.

We also offer up suggestions for elements, tags, some values (as defined in HTML 5), Ionic and AngularJS tags. You can trigger suggestions at any time by pressing `kb(editor.action.triggerSuggest)`.

## Format HTML

To improve the formatting of your HTML code press `kb(editor.action.format)` and the selected area will be reformatted.

>**Tip:** Configure the HTML formatter settings in the [User and Workspace Settings](/docs/customization/userandworkspace.md).

## Emmet snippets

We support Emmet snippet expansion, simply press `kb(editor.emmet.action.expandAbbreviation)`.

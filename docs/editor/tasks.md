# Integrate with External Tools via Tasks

Lots of tools exist to automate tasks like building, packaging, testing or deploying software systems. Examples include [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_software), [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Jake](http://jakejs.com/), [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) and [MSBuild](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild).

![VS Code can talk to a variety of external tools](images/tasks/tasks_hero.png)

These tools are mostly run from the command line and automate jobs outside the inner software development loop (edit, compile, test and debug).  Given their importance in the development life-cycle, it is very helpful to be able run them and analyze their results from within VS Code.

>Please note that task support is only available when working on a workspace folder. It is not available when editing single files.

## Hello World

Let's start with a simple "Hello World" task which will display text to the **OUTPUT** panel when run.

Tasks are defined in a workspace `tasks.json` file and VS Code has templates for common task runners. In the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`), you can filter on 'task' and can see the various Task related commands.

![tasks in command palette](images/tasks/tasks-command-palette.png)

Select the **Tasks: Configure Task Runner** command and you will see a list of task runner templates. Select **Others** to create a task which runs an external command.

You should now see a `tasks.json` file in your workspace `.vscode` folder with the following content:

```json
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "echo",
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "args": ["Hello World"],
    "showOutput": "always"
}
```

In this example, we are just running the `echo` shell command with "Hello World" as an argument.

Test the `echo` task by running **Tasks: Run Tasks** and selecting `echo` from the dropdown. The **OUTPUT** panel will open and you'll see the text "Hello World".

You can get IntelliSense on `tasks.json` variables and their values with hover and trigger smart completions with `kb(editor.action.triggerSuggest)`.

![tasks IntelliSense](images/tasks/tasks-intellisense.png)

>**Tip:** You can run your task through **Quick Open** (`kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)`) by typing 'task', `kbstyle(Space)` and the command name. In this case, 'task echo'.

## Output Window Behavior

Sometimes you will want to control how the output window behaves when running tasks. For instance, you may want to maximize editor space and only look at task output if you think there is a problem. The property **showOutput** controls this and the valid values are:

- **always** - The output window is always brought to front. This is the default.
- **never** - The user must explicitly bring the output window to the front using the **View** > **Toggle Output** command (`kb(workbench.action.output.toggleOutput)`).
- **silent** - The output window is brought to front only if no [problem matchers](/docs/editor/tasks.md#processing-task-output-with-problem-matchers) are set for the task.

## Examples of Tasks in Action

The best way to highlight the power of Tasks is with a few examples of how VS Code can use Tasks to integrate external tools like linters and compilers.

### Transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript

The [TypeScript topic](/docs/languages/typescript.md#transpiling-typescript-into-javascript) includes an example that creates a task to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript and observe any related errors from within VS Code.

### Compiling Markdown to HTML

The Markdown topic provides two examples for compiling Markdown to HTML:

1. [Manually compiling with a Build task](/docs/languages/markdown.md#compiling-markdown-into-html)
2. [Automation of the compile step with a file watcher](/docs/languages/markdown.md#automating-markdown-compilation)

### Transpiling Less and Sass into CSS

The CSS topic provides examples of how to use Tasks to generate CSS files.

1. [Manually transpiling with a Build task](/docs/languages/css.md#transpiling-sass-and-less-into-css)
2. [Automation of the compile step with a file watcher](/docs/languages/css.md#automating-sassless-compilation)

## Processing Task Output with Problem Matchers

VS Code processes the output from a task with a problem matcher and we ship with a number of them 'in the box', we'll talk about how to make your own ones soon:

- **TypeScript**: `$tsc` assumes that file names in the output are relative to the opened folder.
- **TypeScript Watch**: `$tsc-watch` matches problems reported from the `tsc` compiler when executed in watch mode.
- **JSHint**: `$jshint` assumes that file names are reported as an absolute path.
- **JSHint Stylish**: `$jshint-stylish` assumes that file names are reported as an absolute path.
- **ESLint Compact**: `$eslint-compact` assumes that file names in the output are relative to the opened folder.
- **ESLint Stylish**: `$eslint-stylish` assumes that file names in the output are relative to the opened folder.
- **CSharp and VB Compiler**: `$mscompile` assumes that file names are reported as an absolute path.
- **Less**: `$lessCompile` assumes that file names are reported as absolute path.

## Autodetecting Gulp, Grunt and Jake Tasks

VS Code can autodetect tasks from within Gulp, Grunt and Jake files.  This adds their tasks to the task list without requiring additional configuration (unless you need to use a problem matcher, more on that in a moment).

To help make this example more concrete, let's use this simple Gulp file.  This defines two tasks: build and debug. The first compiles C# code using [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/)'s compiler. The second starts the MyApp under the Mono debugger.

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");

var program = "MyApp";
var port = 55555;

gulp.task('default', ['debug']);

gulp.task('build', function() {
    return gulp
        .src('./**/*.cs')
        .pipe(msc(['-fullpaths', '-debug', '-target:exe', '-out:' + program]));
});

gulp.task('debug', ['build'], function(done) {
    return mono.debug({ port: port, program: program}, done);
});
```

Pressing `kb(workbench.action.showCommands)` and then typing `Run Task` followed by `kbstyle(Enter)` will list all available tasks. Selecting one and pressing `kbstyle(Enter)` will execute the task.

![Task list](images/tasks/gulpautodetect.png)

>**Note:** Gulp, Grunt and Jake are autodetected only if the corresponding files (for example `gulpfile.js`) are present in the root of the opened folder.

## Mapping Gulp, Grunt and Jake Output to Problem Matchers

You need to configure the tasks in a `tasks.json` file (located under your workspace `.vscode` folder) if you want to do more than simply run the task.  For example, you might want to match reported problems and highlight them within VS Code, or to trigger a build task using the ** Run Build Task** command (`kb(workbench.action.tasks.build)`).

If you don't already have a `tasks.json` under your workspace `.vscode` folder, running the **Tasks: Configure Task Runner** action from the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) will offer you a set of templates to pick from.

For this example, select `Gulp` from the list. This will generate a `tasks.json` file like this:

```json
{
	// See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
	// for the documentation about the tasks.json format
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"command": "gulp",
	"isShellCommand": true,
	"args": [
		"--no-color"
	],
	"tasks": [
		{
			"taskName": "build",
			"args": [],
			"isBuildCommand": true,
			"isWatching": false,
			"problemMatcher": [
				"$lessCompile",
				"$tsc",
				"$jshint"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

Since we execute the Mono compiler to compile C# files, we use the `$msCompile` problem matcher to detect any problems reported by the compiler.

The `problemMatcher` property will then be:

```json
			"problemMatcher": [
				"$msCompile"
			]
```

In contrast to the `tasks.json` file in the TypeScript section, this file has:

1. We want to run the gulp command in a shell (VS Code directly executing it) so we used **isShellCommand**.
2. We added an explicit **tasks** property which allowed us to *optionally* augment a task that was in the gulpfile.
3. We defined a problem matcher **$msCompile** to process the output - since we are compiling C# using the Mono compiler, the built-in one works as *msc* adheres to the Microsoft compiler pattern.

### Syntax for the Tasks Property

The `tasks` property is defined as an array of object literals where each literal has the following properties:

- **taskName** - The task's name in the Gulp or Jake file.
- **args** - A string array of additional arguments to be passed to the task.
- **isBuildCommand** - If this property is set to true, `kb(workbench.action.tasks.build)` will trigger this task.
- **problemMatcher** A string or array of strings based on the pre-defined problem matchers.

## Operating System Specific Properties

The task system supports defining values (for example, the command to be executed) specific to an operating system. To do so, simply put an operating system specific literal into the `tasks.json` file and specify the corresponding properties inside that literal.

Below is an example that uses the Node.js executable as a command and is treated differently on Windows and Linux:

```json
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "windows": {
        "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe"
    },
    "linux": {
        "command": "/usr/bin/node"
    }
}
```

Valid operating properties are `windows` for Windows, `linux` for Linux and `osx` for Mac OS X. Properties defined in an operating system specific scope override properties defined in the global scope.

In the example below:

```json
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "showOutput": "never",
    "windows": {
        "showOutput": "always"
    }
}
```

Output from the executed task is never brought to front except for Windows where it is always shown.

## Task Specific Properties

The global properties `showOutput` and `suppressTaskName` can be redefined on a task by task basis. The `args` property can be augmented resulting in the additional values being appended to the global arguments.

Here is an example where output for the "deploy" task is always brought to front:

```json
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "showOutput": "silent",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "taskName": "deploy",
            "showOutput": "always",
        }
    ]
}
```

>**Tip:** If a property is redefined per OS and per task, the one from the task wins.

## Variable substitution

When authoring tasks and launch configurations, it is often useful to have a set of predefined common variables.  VS Code supports variable substitution inside strings in the `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files and has the following predefined variables:

- **${workspaceRoot}** the path of the folder opened in VS Code
- **${file}** the current opened file
- **${relativeFile}** the current opened file relative to `workspaceRoot`
- **${fileBasename}** the current opened file's basename
- **${fileDirname}** the current opened file's dirname
- **${fileExtname}** the current opened file's extension
- **${cwd}** the task runner's current working directory on startup

You can also reference environment variables through **${env.Name}** (e.g. ${env.PATH}). Be sure to match the environment variable name's casing, for example `env.Path` on Windows.

Below is an example of a configuration that passes the current opened file to the TypeScript compiler.

```json
{
    "command": "tsc",

    "args": ["${file}"]
}
```

## Defining a Problem Matcher

VS Code ships some of the most common problem matchers out of the box.  However, there are lots of compilers and linting tools out there, all of which produce their own style of errors and warnings.  So let's talk about how to make your own problem matcher.

We have a `helloWorld.c` program in which the developer mistyped **printf**
as **prinft**. Compiling it with [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) will produce the following warning:

```
helloWorld.c:5:3: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘prinft’
```

We want to produce a problem matcher that can capture the message in the output and show a corresponding problem in VS Code.  Problem matchers heavily rely on [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). The section below assumes
you are familiar with regular expressions.

>**Tip:** We have found the [RegEx101 playground](https://regex101.com/) a really good way to develop and test regular expressions.

A matcher that captures the above warning (and errors) looks like:

```json
{
    // The problem is owned by the cpp language service.
    "owner": "cpp",
    // The file name for reported problems is relative to the opened folder.
    "fileLocation": ["relative", "${workspaceRoot}"],
    // The actual pattern to match problems in the output.
    "pattern": {
        // The regular expression. Example to match: helloWorld.c:5:3: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘prinft’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
        "regexp": "^(.*):(\\d+):(\\d+):\\s+(warning|error):\\s+(.*)$",
        // The first match group matches the file name which is relative.
        "file": 1,
        // The second match group matches the line on which the problem occurred.
        "line": 2,
        // The third match group matches the column at which the problem occurred.
        "column": 3,
        // The fourth match group matches the problem's severity. Can be ignored. Then all problems are captured as errors.
        "severity": 4,
        // The fifth match group matches the message.
        "message": 5
    }
}
```
Please note that the file, line and message properties are mandatory.

Here is a finished `tasks.json` file with the code above (comments removed) wrapped with the actual task details:

```json
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "gcc",
    "args": ["-Wall", "helloWorld.c", "-o", "helloWorld"],
    "problemMatcher": {
        "owner": "cpp",
        "fileLocation": ["relative", "${workspaceRoot}"],
        "pattern": {
            "regexp": "^(.*):(\\d+):(\\d+):\\s+(warning|error):\\s+(.*)$",
            "file": 1,
            "line": 2,
            "column": 3,
            "severity": 4,
            "message": 5
        }
    }
}
```

Running it inside VS Code and pressing `kb(workbench.actions.view.problems)` to get the list of problems gives you the following output:

![GCC Problem Matcher](images/tasks/problemmatcher.png)

There are a couple more properties that can be used inside a pattern. These are:

- **location** if the problem location is line or line,column or startLine,startColumn,endLine,endColumn then our generic location match group can be used.
- **endLine** the match group index for the problem's end line. Can be omitted if no end line value is provided by the compiler.
- **endColumn** the match group index for the problem's end column. Can be omitted if no end column value is provided by the compiler.
- **code** the match group index for the problem's code. Can be omitted if no code value is provided by the compiler.

>**Note:** A functional pattern must at least provide a match group for file, message and line or location.


## Defining a Multi-Line Problem Matcher

Some tools spread problems found in a source file over several lines, especially if stylish reporters are used. An example is [ESLint](http://eslint.org/); in stylish mode it produces output like this:

```
test.js
  1:0   error  Missing "use strict" statement                 strict
✖ 1 problems (1 errors, 0 warnings)
```

Our problem matcher is line-based so we need to capture the file name (test.js) with a different regular expression than the actual problem location and message (1:0   error  Missing "use strict" statement).

To do this we use an array of problem patterns for the **pattern** property. This way you define a pattern per each line you want to match.

The following problem pattern matches the output from ESLint in stylish mode - but still has one small issue which we will resolve next.  The code below has a first regular expression to capture the file name and the second to capture the line, column, severity, message and error code:

```json
{
    "owner": "javascript",
    "fileLocation": ["relative", "${workspaceRoot}"],
    "pattern": [
        {
            "regexp": "^([^\\s].*)$",
            "file": 1
        },
        {
            "regexp": "^\\s+(\\d+):(\\d+)\\s+(error|warning|info)\\s+(.*)\\s\\s+(.*)$",
            "line": 1,
            "column": 2,
            "severity": 3,
            "message": 4,
            "code": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

Of course it's never quite that simple, and this pattern will not work if there is more than one problem on a resource. For instance, imagine the following output from ESLint:

```
test.js
  1:0   error  Missing "use strict" statement                 strict
  1:9   error  foo is defined but never used                  no-unused-vars
  2:5   error  x is defined but never used                    no-unused-vars
  2:11  error  Missing semicolon                              semi
  3:1   error  "bar" is not defined                           no-undef
  4:1   error  Newline required at end of file but not found  eol-last
✖ 6 problems (6 errors, 0 warnings)
```

The pattern's first regular expression will match "test.js", the second "1:0  error ...". The next line "1:9  error ..." is processed but not matched by the first regular expression and so no problem is captured.

To make this work, the last regular expression of a multi-line pattern can specify the **loop** property. If set to **true**, it instructs the task system to apply the last pattern of a multi-line matcher to the lines in the output as long as the regular expression matches.

The information captured by all previous patterns is combined with the information captured by the last pattern and turned into a problem inside VS Code.

Here is a problem matcher to fully capture ESLint stylish problems:

```json
{
    "owner": "javascript",
    "fileLocation": ["relative", "${workspaceRoot}"],
    "pattern": [
        {
            "regexp": "^([^\\s].*)$",
            "file": 1
        },
        {
            "regexp": "^\\s+(\\d+):(\\d+)\\s+(error|warning|info)\\s+(.*)\\s\\s+(.*)$",
            "line": 1,
            "column": 2,
            "severity": 3,
            "message": 4,
            "code": 5,
            "loop": true
        }
    ]
}
```

## Common Questions

**Q: How can I define multiple tasks to run different commands?**

**A:** Defining multiple tasks in `tasks.json` is not yet fully supported by VS Code (see [#981](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/981)). You can work around this limitation by running your task commands through a shell command (`sh` on Linux and OS X, `cmd` on Windows).

Here is an example to add two tasks for `make` and `ls`:

```json
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "sh",
    "args": ["-c"],
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "showOutput": "always",
    "suppressTaskName": true,
    "tasks": [
        {
            "taskName": "make",
            "args": ["make"]
        },
        {
            "taskName": "ls",
            "args": ["ls"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Both tasks `make` and `ls` will be visible in the **Tasks: Run Task** dropdown.

For Windows, you will need to pass the '/C' argument to `cmd` so that the tasks arguments are run.

```json
    "command": "cmd",
    "args: ["/C"]
```

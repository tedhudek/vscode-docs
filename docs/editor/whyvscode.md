# Why Visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code provides developers with a new choice of developer tool that combines the simplicity and streamlined experience of a code editor with the best of what developers need for their core code-build-debug cycle. Visual Studio Code is the first code editor, and first cross-platform development tool - supporting OS X, Linux, and Windows - in the Visual Studio family.

At its heart, Visual Studio Code features a powerful, fast source code editor great for day-to-day use. VS Code has many of the features developers need in a code and text editor, including navigation, keyboard support with customizable bindings, syntax highlighting, bracket matching, auto indentation, and snippets, with support for dozens of languages.

For serious coding, developers often need to work with code as more than just text. Visual Studio Code includes built-in support for always-on IntelliSense code completion, richer semantic code understanding and navigation, and code refactoring. VS Code includes enriched built-in support for Node.js development with TypeScript and JavaScript, powered by the same underlying technologies that drive Visual Studio. VS Code includes great tooling for web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Less, Sass, and JSON. VS Code also integrates with package managers, repositories and build tools to perform common tasks to make everyday workflows faster. And VS Code understands Git, and delivers great Git workflows and source diffs integrated with the editor.

But developers don't spend all their time just writing code: they go back and forth between coding and debugging. Debugging is the most popular feature in Visual Studio, and often the one feature from an IDE that developers want in a leaner coding experience. Visual Studio Code includes a streamlined, integrated debugging experience, with support for Node.js debugging for example.

Architecturally, Visual Studio Code combines the best of web, native, and language-specific technologies. Using [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), VS Code combines web technologies such as JavaScript and Node.js with the speed and flexibility of native apps. VS Code uses a newer, faster version of the same industrial-strength HTML-based editor that has powered the “Monaco” cloud editor, Internet Explorer's F12 Tools, and other projects. And VS Code uses a tools service architecture that enables it to use many of the same technologies that power Visual Studio, including Roslyn for .NET, TypeScript, the Visual Studio debugging engine, and more. Visual Studio Code includes a public extensibility model that lets developers build and use extensions, and richly customize their edit-build-debug experience.

If you prefer a code editor-centric development tool or are building cross-platform web and cloud applications, we invite you to try out the Visual Studio Code and let us know what you think!
